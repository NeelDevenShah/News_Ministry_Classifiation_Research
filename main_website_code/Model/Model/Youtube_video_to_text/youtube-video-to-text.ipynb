did he could have waited for the investigation to end he could have given proof he could have also handled it diplomatically instead he made the statement in Parliament it's a dramatic move it's also a political move through the wanted this issue to blow up he wanted the attention and the coverage he wanted this cash with India the question is why after all India is not China or Russia or North Korea we're not talking about some room state or Western Drive we are talking about the world's largest democracy so very important Western partner why did Justin Trudeau make a spectacle out of this to answer that we need to understand Canada's politics basically two things about it the last general election was held in the year 2021 in Parliament but they were shot of majority around 10:00 that's when entered the picture of Palestine Canada's new Democratic party thanks to Japanese support Trudeau became prime minister if he leaves to leave he will be out of power do you see why that's a problem Justin Trudeau to stay in power so is it really surprising that he feels Palestinians that's one reasonin the polar arithmetic the second reason is a Sikh vote in Canada around 2.1% of Canada's population is seek it is the fastest growing religious group in the country today you can see seats in top positions in government in the corporate sector even in Canada's Armed Forces not all of them are Palestinians and this distinction is very very important to make most Canadians are well-meaning rule-abiding people the problem is Canada's leaders have got to draw they think seek equals Holliston so what do they do they ignore the support the holidays it's a tactic that has that is almost as old as elections here in India we have different terms for it because Justin Trudeau is doing the very same thing supporting terrorists and justifying it as freedom of expression and don't think Justin Trudeau is the first leader to play this card his father did the same he was Canada's prime minister in the 1970s and 80s that was a peek of the movement in 1982 India wanted to extend from Canada this man that are used to lead a group called Salsa India wanted his extraction but Pierre Trudeau then prime minister of Canada refused to expedite him and the decision made no sense bothIndia and Canada a commonwealth country so technically extradition should have been easy then why did senior Trudeau refuse report say because India was not differential to the Queen of England I wish I was making this up you say India considered the queen to be the head of the Commonwealth Canada considered her to be the head of state and this difference apparently irked peer Trudeau so no extradition of the Palestine it would prove to be a costly blunder in 1985 the same planted bombs on an Air India plane 329 people were killed until 9:11 it was the worst Aviation attack Canada let that happen their official investigation has confirmed this it talked about error incompetence and in attention I'll repeat that era incompetence and in attention these three words summed up Canada's policy in the 1970s and 1980s Unfortunately they apply even today to Rosewood Bank politics is dangerous he is putting Canadians address just think about it where are the Houston is based in Canada where are they holding their called referendums in Canada and where have they plotted attacks again in Canada India has effectively defend this movement but in Canada it is thrivingdiplomatic missions on Hindu temples even businesses run by Indians how long before they turn their attention to Canadians 2 father waited to find out his mistake cost $329 innocent lives we can only hope it's not
